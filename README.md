# C2.2 Homological Algebra - Lecture notes

This repository contains the lecture notes for the course C2.2 Homological Algebra at the Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, based on what was delivered during the Michaelmas term of the 2023-24 academic year by Prof. Kobi Kremnitzer. These notes are partially based on a previous version by Sebastian Monnet.

## How to Compile the Notes

These lecture notes are written using [Typst](https://typst.app/), a modern typesetting system. To compile the notes and watch for changes, follow these steps:

1. **Install Typst**: You can download and install Typst from [here](https://typst.app/download) (if you haven't already).

2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EricWay1024/Homological-Algebra-Notes.git
   cd Homological-Algebra-Notes
   ```

3. **Compile the notes**: To compile and watch for changes, run the following command:
    ```
    typst watch main.typ
    ```

This will compile the file and automatically regenerate the output every time you save changes.
