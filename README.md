# Lecture Notes for University of Oxford course C2.2 Homological Algebra (Michaelmas, 2023-24)

Go to [Release](https://github.com/EricWay1024/Homological-Algebra-Notes/releases) for the latest compiled PDF, both the colourful (for screen viewing) and not-so-colourful version (for printing).

Written with [Typst](https://typst.app/).
To compile and watch for changes:
```
typst watch main.typ
```

Also check out [this repo of mine](https://github.com/EricWay1024/tikzcd-editor) for drawing commutative diagrams in Typst.

Any issues and pull requests are welcome.
